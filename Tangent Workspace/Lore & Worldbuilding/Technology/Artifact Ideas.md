## Warehouse Design:
"Ichor", a substance that is converted from magnetism and can convert back into magnetism and radiation allowing the construction of "G-Pinch" batteries, a form of stored power source. It gains substantial weight and density when charged. A special way to discharge makes it have negative mass which enabled the invention of the "Dimensional Engine" and "anti-gravity shielding". Such engines can convert electrical signals into gravitational waves, which are the basis of teleportation. It also allows the construction of 4th dimensional geometries and machinery.

Bioprinter? How? Of interest to Agarthians and potential macguffin.
