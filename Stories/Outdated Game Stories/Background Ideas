The Initial Incident.
- During WW2, Germany is launching V1 missile strikes on London. One of them hits a Symposium building, penetrating to the basement but not exploding. Agarthians evacuate the building, leaving it abandoned. The Government cordons off the building because they want to retrieve and reverse-engineer the German wonder weapon. 
- When they get inside the building to investigate they are surprised to find the much more impressive Agarthian technology. Whatever they can lift off the ground is shipped to the US where they start researching AGM, leading to the Philadelphia Experiment.
- One of the Transporters was in the middle of incarnating Indro, the engineer-technician. Interrogations of her lead the government to be aware that many more artifacts exist and so the Warehouse is founded to safekeep and find further uses of Agarthian technology.
- Several of the crates of artifacts from the Initial Incident are misplaced by spies and now several clandestine groups have their own collection of Agarthian artifacts, trying invent strange devices from them.
- The Warehouse forms the Cornerstone Institute as a facade for their own innovation, derived from the experience of the Philadelphia experiment, they are constructing a Teleporter dubbed "Cross Pollinator" (X-Poll for short).


How are artifacts located?
- Ectoplasm homing by X-Poll
- Initial incident investigations
- "MIB" Agarthian activity whis is surveilled by Warehouse after harassment denouncements.
- The Philadelphia Experiment scattered items from the Initial Incident across remote locations on the globe to be retrieved.
- Indro has been producing her own artifacts and littering them.
- Warehouse rivals have their own collections of artifacts which need to be removed. Each collection dubbed an "X-Lab".

The X-Labs angle.
- Warehouse builds a series of labs to research the Noosphere.
- A Warehouse rival builds a series of labs to research the Noosphere.
- Multiple Warehouse rivals build their own X-Lab to develop differnt kinds of devices.
- The Agarthian Council insdiously (without Agartha's knowledge) builds a series of facilies as part of a breeding program. (Mirajo & Salamandro)


Why does Seigro and Eksono join Chevron?
- They are agents on a mission to misdirect the Warehouse away from Agarthian facilities.
- Agarthians enter a deal with Warehouse. X-Poll allows Agarthians to raid rivals of Warehouse, from where they want to recover their technology.
