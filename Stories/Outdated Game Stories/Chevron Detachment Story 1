* The Word "Fabricator" is used for more clarity, but Agarthians use the word "Transporter" for the device.
* "Rainbow Mainframe" is a rack of orgone computers that Agarthians built as substrate for the cyberspace of Agartha.

[[[
Catherine Meyer is being transported by the Fabricator.
Her lifetime memories bleed into Seibra who's being transported into the material world at the same time.

{Enjoy The Silence}

[In synch with the song, Seibra's internal subconscious monologue whispers...]
Come crashing into my little world.
Painful to me, pierce right through me.
Can't you understand? Oh, my little girl.

[[[
Seibra wakes up all slimey and oozing of the decaying ectoplasm that drains into the grating on the Fabricator bed. The Fabricator won't produce hair, so she is completely bald, including body hair.
Everyone looking directly at her is horrified, someone in the background is calling assistance and rushing to wear protective equipment. The voices all sound muffled for a while until full consciousness returns.

[It is implied that Seibra talks an unknown language]
SEIBRA: This isn't the Transporter chamber! Identify yourselves, where have you brought me?!
RESEARCHER-1: Major Catherine! What happened to you?
[Seibra looks back and down on the Fabricator looking spooked]
RESEARCHER-2: I think we've lost Catherine, sir...
SEIBRA: No! The Rainbow isn't here! The Agent isn't here! You bastards!

[[[
Everyone in the room has been slowly walking away and now they have reached the airlock which immediately closes to shut Seibra in the containment chamber.
An emergency light can be seen churning inside the airlock where the people hide.
The walls are glass and like in an interrogation room, a lot of interested people are witnessing through.

A moment of clarity settles in... the camera zooms in as the intense look on Seibra's face melts into a composed ten yard stare. She can only monologue internally for now...

"These people just lost someone for me and I can't do anything about it without the Agartha Rainbow Mainframe. My team mate isn't going to be here eiter. There's only one Fabricator, probably barely any power to run it too. I'm locked up lonely, these people hate me and don't understand my language so I can't tell them what happened.
I don't know where I am anyway, how couldn't have I known about it?..."

An hour passes by. There's an analogue clock on the wall. The emergency lights have been switched for faint darkness. A stronger light inside containment chamber keeps Seibra from seeing the outside. She wonders if she should have brought night vision...

Judging by the silluette, someone sits against the glass. I don't understand what they say, but quickly find a paper and try to transcribe it.

ETHAN LENNOX: So they say you aren't Catherine, but somehow she was there with you, right? Your genome is unusually short, so you can't be Catherine. But where did you take her? I hope you don't have a disease at least... We are keeping the chamber staff in isolation for now, though.

[Blinders reveal a handful of people in a similar parallel room, all sitting in a circle]

ETHAN LENNOX: I guess you can't understand me. But you still need to perform a physical test...

[A dropbox on the airlock opens with a medical scrub inside. As Seibra comes to pick it up, the airlock opens]

[The only way is through and into a tactical combat tutorial sequence]
