[Seibra and Exfon wake up from their first night since being re-united in the material world]
SEIBRA: Did you had good dreams?
EXFON: Would you like me to show them?...~
[Seibra and Exfon kiss tenderly]
EXFON: Something like that.
SEIBRA: Oh yeah? And I wasn't part of it?
EXFON: Not this time, but you are now.~
